## Introduction

The challenge was to build a responsive blog preview card that displays key information about a blog post. This includes the post's title, publication date, description, and author. The project uses custom fonts and styles to enhance the visual appeal of the card.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/navidTabrizi90/blog-preview-card.git

    ```

2. Open the project directory:
    ```bash
     cd blog-preview-card
    ```
3. Open the HTML file (index.html) in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file to view the blog preview card. The card is styled using CSS, and you can customize the styles further in the `style.css` file.
